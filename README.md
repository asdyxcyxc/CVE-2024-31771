Steps:
1. Download a malicious DLL generated by msfvenom (part of the metasploit exploitation software package). In the video, I was targeting a DLL loaded by Windows Update service. 
2. After the DLL has been quarantined, create a junction to link the download file location to C:\Windows\System32\ for example linking c:\users\<username>\downloads\test 
3. Restore the DLL, the file is now written to the junction - C:\Windows\System32\
   - Using eicar as example, it was written by NT\SYSTEM

4. After restoring, the DLL is detected as a threat the second time and moved to quarantine again 
5. If the DLL is restored from Quarantine again, the file is written to C:\Windows\System32\ again
6. If Windows Update services are then triggered, it loads the malicious DLL and the attacker obtains nt authority\SYSTEM privileges.
